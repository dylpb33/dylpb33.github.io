title: Week 3

For my third week of the DREAM program I started analyzing more medical applications that would be suitable for computational performance testing. Dr. Belviranli tasked me with finding about 3-4 applicaitons that I thought would be best suited for our work. The things I looked for were applications that had specific requirements that needed to be met. For example some applications require long battery life or low latency in order to carry out their specific operations. These requirements can then be met through various manipulations of the systems such as changing the CPUs and GPUs.
