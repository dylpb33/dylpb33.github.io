title: Week 8
---

In week 8 of my DREAM research I attended another mock presentation for another student in Dr. Belvirnali's lab. We were able to give live feedback throughout the presenation, which helped to provide additional information for the presented and myself on which information needs to be included in a scholarly presenation. The various network implementations were discussed with Dr. Belviranli however none of them seemed adequate so we decided to continue searching for an improved implemenation on github.
