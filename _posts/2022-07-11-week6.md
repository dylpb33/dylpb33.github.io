title: Week 6

This is week six of my DREAM research. During this time I attended a mock presentation for an upcoming conference paper presented by another student in Dr. Belviranli's lab. This presentaion was helpful in getting a better understanding of the level of detail required for a presentation of this magnitude. I was also able to discuss the network implementation we were looking at previously and how we may use this in the future.
