For my first week in the DREAM program I was tasked with performing background research on the topic my research advisor and I came to find that would allow for crossover between the lab's research and my own interests. We decided to look into improving the computational efficiency of medical devices, as I have a background in biology, and Dr. Belviranli has done research on improving system performance. To facilitate in this process I read a paper on edge-computing and how it was being used in various medical applications. The paper also had a few relevant references that I explored to further understand each specific system. I then set out on finding code, much of which is uploaded on github, to help in seeing some of the implementation of edge computing systems and how it they are strucutred. I am excited to learn more about this area of computer science and build my research project from my continued learning of this area that is new to me.
