In my second week of research I looked into how edge computing systems are constructed. I looked through various implementations of virtual edge computing systems that were uploaded on github to help with this. Many of the systems had guides that walked through the architecture and use of these systems. Dr. Belviranli and I believed this could be a good way to help in modeling the systems we were eventually planning to test. There are a couple azure connected devices in the lab that we thought could be beneficial in helping with this task so I looked at a few different azure related edge systems utilizing this service. I plan to continue on leanring about these implementations to help with our future work.
