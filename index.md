## About Me

I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from University of Wisconsin - Madison along with a certificate in Global Health in 2020. I then started the computer science Bridge program at Colorado School of Mines in the Fall of 2021. This program helps students without a computer science background gain a Master's degree in computer science. I plan to graduate with my Master's degree in the spring of 2023.

During my time as an undergrad at UW - Madison I conducted neurophysiology research on ischemia and long term potentiation. I wrote the following paper that details this area of neuroscience:

## About My Advisor

Mehmet Belviranli

Assistant Professor, Computer Science

Dr. Belviranli received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from University of California, Riverside in 2016. Prior to joining Mines, he continued his research and mentoring activities at Oak Ridge National Laboratory as Staff Computer Scientist.  Mehmetâ€™s main research interests are targeted at increasing resource utilization in heterogeneous architectures. He developed runtime systems, scheduling algorithms, analytical models, extended memory spaces, programming abstractions and OS & architecture level support to make heterogeneous computing more efficient. His work has been published in major HPC and architecture related conferences including MICRO, PPoPP, SC, ICS, PACT and DATE.

## About My Project

For my DREAM project I plan on looking into improving the computational efficiency of medical devices. We plan on setting up a system that simulates an electrocardiogram (ECG) and then performing a few maniuplations of the computing system to test the systems performance with these changes. The ECG requires a long battery life in order function properly so we will look into forming a system to help with this need.
