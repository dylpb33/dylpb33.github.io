## About Me

I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from University of Wisconsin - Madison along with a certificate in Global Health in 2020. I then started the computer science Bridge program at Colorado School of Mines in the Fall of 2021. This program helps students without a computer science background gain a Master's degree in computer science. I plan to graduate with my Master's degree in the spring of 2023.
